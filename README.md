Emera - DNA Sequences analysis platform
====================

Purpose of the platform
---------------------

Provide scientists a way to connect to their Illumina BaseSpace account.
Retrieve, and start lookup analyses on these data by leveraging nowadays technologies such as parrallel processing. One kind of analysis is offered today : subsequences lookup (by pattern definition) and generation of various occurences reports on the genes. 
This project provide a highly scalable, fault tolerant system based on Amazon Web Services, as well as Physical machines to perform the computations. The client app is available amongst the projects.
